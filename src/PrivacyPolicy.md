Privacy Policy for Miami Pickup Basketball
Last Updated: May 7, 2025
üèÄ Slam Dunk into Privacy! ü¶© Welcome to Miami Pickup Basketball, the ultimate app for finding and joining pickup basketball games across Miami's sun-soaked courts. Just like a well-executed pick-and-roll, we‚Äôre committed to keeping your data safe and your game strong. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, share, and protect your information while you hoop it up with us. Let‚Äôs break it down like a fast break!
1. The Tip-Off: Information We Collect
We collect data to keep the game flowing smoothly, like a point guard dishing assists. Here‚Äôs what we gather:

Player Profile Stats: When you sign up, we collect your email, player name (your court alias!), and optional details like phone number or profile picture to personalize your experience.
Game Play Data: Details about games you join or create, including dates, times, locations (e.g., South Beach courts), and notes, so we can match you with the right squads.
Technical Dribble: Device info (e.g., browser type, IP address), app usage data (e.g., pages visited), and cookies to keep the app running like a well-timed alley-oop.
Social Media Swish: If you share games on X or other platforms, we may collect related data (e.g., post interactions) to boost community vibes.

2. How We Use Your Data: The Game Plan
We use your info to make every game a highlight reel:

Court Connections: Match you with pickup games, notify you about game updates, and display your player name to teammates.
App Improvements: Analyze usage to enhance features, like adding new courts or refining game filters, ensuring the app‚Äôs a slam dunk.
Communication: Send you game invites, reminders, or app updates (e.g., new features or Miami events) via email or push notifications, if you opt in.
Community Hype: Promote games or events on X or other platforms, using your shared content to grow the Miami basketball scene.

3. Sharing Your Data: Passing the Ball
We don‚Äôt sell your data‚Äîno fouls here! We only share when it‚Äôs part of the play:

Teammates: Your player name and game details (e.g., time, location) are visible to other players in games you join or create.
Service Providers: Trusted partners (e.g., Firebase for data storage, Render for hosting) process data on our behalf, following strict privacy rules.
Legal Layups: We may share data if required by law (e.g., court order) or to protect the app, users, or public safety, like defending against a technical turnover.
Social Media: If you share games on X, your post content is public, but we don‚Äôt share additional personal data.

4. Your Choices: Calling Your Own Plays
You‚Äôre the MVP of your data. Here‚Äôs how you control the court:

Profile Management: Update or delete your player name, phone number, or other details in the app‚Äôs Profile section.
Notifications: Opt out of email or push notifications via app settings or unsubscribe links.
Cookies: Adjust browser settings to block cookies, though this may limit app functionality (like missing a free throw).
Data Requests: Contact us at bshoemak@mac.com to access, correct, or delete your data, or to opt out of data sharing.

5. Data Security: Defending the Paint
We guard your data like a shot-blocker at the rim:

Encryption: Data is encrypted in transit (e.g., HTTPS) and at rest (e.g., Firebase security).
Access Controls: Only authorized team members access your data, and we use strong authentication.
Regular Checks: We monitor for vulnerabilities, keeping the app as secure as a full-court press.
Disclaimer: No system is a guaranteed dunk, so stay vigilant (e.g., don‚Äôt share your password).

6. Children‚Äôs Privacy: No Kids‚Äô Court
This app is for players 13 and up. We don‚Äôt knowingly collect data from kids under 13. If we learn a young baller slipped through, we‚Äôll delete their data faster than a steal in transition. Parents, contact us at bshoemak@mac.com with concerns.
7. International Players: Global Game
Based in Miami, we operate under U.S. laws. If you‚Äôre hooping from outside the U.S., your data may be transferred to our servers in the States. By using the app, you consent to this, ready to play on our court.
8. Changes to This Policy: New Playbook
We may update this policy as the app evolves, like tweaking a game plan. Check https://miami-pickup-basketball.onrender.com/ for the latest version. Major changes will be announced via email or app notifications, so you‚Äôre never caught off-guard.
